#### Tell me about yourself.

Hello, My name is Youfu, a Computer Science and Technology graduate from Jiangnan University. I'm living in Wuxi.I have worked in the computer field for ten years.

I have been working at Midea Group as a data analyst and project manager for 4 years. I participated in several campus self-service projects, including the laundry, shower room and water purifier.

My routine works cover data analysis, software development, and team management.

From past working experiences, I learnt how to effectively complete a project and  develop a Proof-of-Concept quickly. I enjoy discovering the awesome tools and share them with others.

I like reading and drumming in my free time.

I'm so happy to be here and looking forward to working with you in the near future.

Thank you for the opportunity.
